# Vue 3 + Vite

Single page PWA app built using vite with vue3. Finally got the bastard to download on my phone after 4 hours of messing with the manifest and service worker files, would download no problem on my mac but wouldnt do it on my phone

It is now download able, you can click on the "Share" icon when you are in your browser and then scroll down to the "Add to homescreen" option and click that. It will format the page as an app on your homescreen

//personal notes

pwa-asset-generator {path to icon} icons
then copy the icon object from the terminal window
